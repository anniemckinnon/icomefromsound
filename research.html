      LOOK – BEHIND YOU!  – Annie McKinnon 8 May 2025<br>
UNSW  – Social Agency Studio 1 - Assessment 3<br>

The first act I took on my journey at architecture school was to look at this Monsterra plant and without taking my eyes off it I was asked to draw what I was seeing on paper with a piece of charcoal. I’ve continued this practice of seeing and committing ideas to paper ever since.

As students of architecture we go to a site, we’re encouraged to use our senses to map our surroundings, but there is a great emphasis on our eyes and what we can see. The visual sense also dominates when it comes to the communication of our designs – we draw, we model, we render, we animate, we build.
According to Bernhard Lietner, whose book I’ve bought along, perceiving space is made possible via a combination of visual, acoustic, and haptic-kinaesthetic impressions. The eyes do most of the work, but they are very poor at assessing what is next to us or behind us. Our ears are there to make up for this deficiency. 
The ear is a sensitive gauge of motion, one that makes conclusions about space whenever sounds are present. You might have had the experience of sitting in a cathedral and feeling a sense of grandeur and airiness – in that moment can you remember what you attributed those feelings to – was is what you could see in front of you, a large tall and open space, or were you also aware of the impact of the acoustics on your perception?

 Lietner argues, and I tend to agree, our ears as tools for perceiving space have become increasingly forgotten, abandoned when it comes to design. Perhaps this is because things that can be seen are more easily measured and communicated, or is it because we are just more practiced at this form of measurement and communication?
I come from sound. What I mean by that is that my first career before coming to pursue architecture was in sound and music design. As part of my training in becoming a sound designer I learnt many different skills including composition, sound engineering, live sound and instrument design.
In contrast to my first act at architecture school, my first act at sound school was to close my eyes and to use my ears to ‘tune-in’ to the world around me. I was made to listen to the classroom, to listen to where I was in it, and what was around me. 
As I became more experienced in this field, I did feel as though my ears were becoming more ‘tuned-in’. In the recording studio it was a particularly necessary skill especially when I was working as a sound engineer and my primary objective was trying to capture the perfect performance on a microphone.
In the studio we can control ‘the recording’ or the capturing of ‘the composition’. In contrast, outside - on site - we are exposed to a live ‘symphony’ of sound, a liveness – one that feels out of our ‘control’, we are not able to ‘produce’ or ‘conduct’, and our ears have to work to take everything in. Outside, wherever that is, is a live performance of many composers – whether each ‘composer’ realises their contribution or not. I have begun to think that some kind of architecture might assist in this realisation (for humans that is, the birds should just keep improvising). 

I’d like you all to listen to a recording I made at Alexandria. It will play with an animation of a graphical notation I have created to help identify the different sound sources.

Now having seen this, if I show you a different image that features the same graphical language – are you able to imagine what this image below might sound like? <br>

When I drew this, I was imagining it might be what the site in Alexandria sounds like in 10 years’ time with a rapid population increase and an even busier airport. <br>
